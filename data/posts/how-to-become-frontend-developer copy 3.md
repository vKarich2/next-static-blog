Becoming a frontend developer involves learning various technologies, acquiring practical skills, and building a portfolio of projects. Here's a detailed step-by-step guide to help you on your journey:

## Step 1: Learn the Basics

![HTML5](https://openwebsolutions.in/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/banner-1.jpg "HTML5")

### Learn HTML

HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is the foundation of web development. It structures the content on the web, using tags to define elements like headings, paragraphs, links, images, and more.

#### Code Example:

##### HTML
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Web Page</title>
	<link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
	<script src="script.js"></script>
</head>
<body>
	<header>
		<nav>
			<ul>
				<li><a href="/">Home</a></li>
				<li><a href="/about">About</a></li>
				<li><a href="/contact">Contact</a></li>
			</ul>
		</nav>
	</header>
	<main>
		<h1>Hello, World!</h1>
	</main>
	<footer>
		<p>&copy; 2024 My Website. All rights reserved.</p>
	</footer>
</body>
</html>
```
